Assignment 3: If/else, switch, logical operators

 

 

Now that you know about the data types in your programming language, it's time to start actually using them.  Find out how the following control statements are written in your language, and write an example of each.  If your language doesn't support these control statements specifically (for example, not all languages have switch statements), try to find a way to emulate the behavior in other ways

 

- a one-condition if/else statement (i.e. "if x == true")
- a multi-condition if/else statement (i.e. "if x>0 && y< 10)
- if/elif/else statements
- short-circuit logic
- a switch-case statement
 

For your write-up, answer the following questions:

1. What are the boolean values in your language? (e.g., True and False, true and false, 1, and 0, etc.)
2. What types of conditional statements are available in your language? (if/else, if/then/else, if/elseif/else).  Does your language allow for statements other than “if” (for example, Perl has an “unless” statement, which does the opposite of “if”!)
3. How does your language delimit code blocks under each condition in selection control statements?
4. Does your language use short-circuit evaluation? Include an example of the short-circuit logic working or not working (or both, if your language is like Java and supports both!)
5. How does your programming language deal with the “dangling else” problem?
6. If your language supports switch or case statements, do you have to use “break” to get out of them? Can you use “continue” to have all of the conditions evaluated?
 

If your language doesn't support anything like this, then explain why not and what it does instead (e.g. the functional languages. Feel free to check in with me on this if you aren't sure what your language does).

 

Make sure that your answers are clear, accurate, and fully-formed: remember that these tutorials are public, and GitHub users don't have the context of the assignment that you do.  Explain the reasoning behind the answers as much as possible.  If there is no clear-cut answer to a question, explain why not.  And cite your sources! 

 

You should incorporate code into your tutorial to show examples, and you should have a file in your repository that is just commented code, that demonstrates how all of these FoPC statements are written in your language.  This should be a file that someone could download and run.
